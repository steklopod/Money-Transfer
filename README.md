# Money Transfer REST API

*Technologies*: `Kotlin`, `Gradle`, `SparkJava`, `H2 Database`, `Exposed`, `JUnit`.  

### Requirements:

1. You can use Java, Scala or `Kotlin`;
2. Keep it simple and to the point (_e.g. no need to implement any authentication_);
3. Assume the API is invoked by multiple systems and services on behalf of end users;
4. You can use frameworks/libraries if you like (_except Spring_), but don't forget about
requirement #2 â€“ keep it simple and avoid heavy frameworks;
5. The datastore should run in-memory for the sake of this test;
6. The final result should be executable as a _standalone program_ (should not require
a pre-installed container/server);
7. Demonstrate with tests that the API works as expected.
